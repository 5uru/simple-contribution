## Introduction

This is a very simple project to help first-time contributors to easily participate and contribute to an open-source project and get more comfortable in using GitHub.

### Who can contribute?

Anybody can contribute to this project whether or not you're a developer or not so long as you want to make a contribution to a project.
- This is for absolute beginners. If you know how to write and edit an anchor tag `<a href="" target=""></a>` then you should be able to do it.
- It is also for those with a little more experience but who want to make their first open source contribution, or get more contributions for more experience and confidence.

It's simple, there's an already created card template in the HTML file which has been marked where to start and where to stop all you have to do is to make a copy of the card template and customize it with your own information. To contribute, read the (/contribution.md) to get an explicit guide on the whole process of contributing starting from setting up Github to creating a pull request. If you're an advanced developer and you want to take it up a notch, read the (/advanced-contribution.md) to get started.
